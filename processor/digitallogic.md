though it might look like it's not invalid. it is racing! cannot even take a screenshot cause it's racing so fast!
Note : NOR JK FLIP FLOPs require same side connection from Q AND Q' with 3 AND.
       NAND JK FLIP FLOP require opposite side flip flop with 3 NAND.

Suppose you just wanna turn off your output. you can do it now!
- NOTE : the three states are,
        1. ON STATE
        2. OFF STATE
        3. DISABLED STATE
    on state and off state are both information, but disabled is for safety, so we don't use it unnecessarily! 
- DO NOT INTREPRET DISABLED AS OFF STATE.
